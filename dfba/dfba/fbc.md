# fbc & DFBA talking points
# Guidelines and examples
- short presentation about the models & how to encode them



## Open issue

- 'biomass' SBO term needed for X (https://sourceforge.net/p/sbo/term-request/120/)
- fbc additions
    - additional constraints to fully encode the LP problem, like for instance combination of 
    fluxes like: v1 + v2 < 10; v1<v3;
    - definition of DFBA algorithms, i.e. parsimonous FBA (flux minimization)


## TODO: 
- finish figures & slides (example models & simulation results)
- figure about connections between top, update, bounds & fba
